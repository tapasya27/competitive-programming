## NeetCode 150 Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the famously known **NeetCode 150** questions, a curated set of problems aimed at technical interview preparations. 
Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest optimizations. 

## Strategies:

### Arrays and Hashing
1. Unique element in a list -> Whenever encountering a need to find a unique element, think if a set can be utilised over sorting as sets are optimised structures that only hold unique elements. They also save on space complexity as a set will occupy a maximum of O(n) space whereas sorting will take O(n log n) 

2. Counting -> Whenever in a requirement to count anything, see if a dictionary can be used to save frequencies of letters. Lookup is only O(1) as well.
